# Release 1.0.4

### Fixed
- **UI Contrast**: Fixed readability issue in Light Mode where usage statistics (CPU/RAM/Disk) appeared as white text on a light background. Changed to adaptive system colors for perfect contrast in both Light and Dark modes.
- **Light Mode Colors**: Adjusted Green/Red/Orange status colors to be less "neon" and more legible when using Light Mode, while retaining the vibrant look in Dark Mode.
- **Transparency**: Added a subtle background tint to improve legibility on colorful wallpapers while maintaining the frosted glass effect.
